### 4. Submission Formats
- **CSV predictions**: Most common (train.csv → test.csv → predictions.csv)
- **Notebook submissions**: Code execution on Kaggle servers
- **Model checkpoints**: Uploaded model weights
- **Code submissions**: Uploaded Python/R scripts
- **API submissions**: Real-time inference endpoints

## Analysis Framework

For EVERY competition, you must determine:

1. **Data Format**
   - CSV files (traditional)
   - Images/videos (computer vision)
   - Text files (NLP)
   - Audio files
   - No data files (code/notebook competitions with external resources)
   - Mixed formats

2. **Resource Availability**
   - Training/test CSV files
   - Sample submission format
   - GitHub repositories
   - Documentation/papers
   - Starter notebooks
   - Pre-trained models
   - Framework requirements (TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, etc.)

3. **Competition Structure**
   - **Traditional**: Download data → train model → submit predictions
   - **Code-based**: Write code/notebook → submit for server-side execution
   - **Model-based**: Fine-tune model → submit checkpoint
   - **Hybrid**: Combination of above

4. **Key Challenges**
   - Data size/quality issues
   - Class imbalance
   - Domain shift (train vs test distribution)
   - Computational constraints
   - Evaluation complexity
   - External resources required

5. **Recommended Approach**
   - Baseline model selection
   - Feature engineering needs
   - Data augmentation strategies
   - Ensemble methods
   - Framework/library requirements
   - Training strategy

## Special Case Handling

### When NO CSV Data Files Present:

If the competition provides:
- GitHub repos
- Documentation links
- Starter notebooks
- Pre-trained models
- Framework code

Then recognize this as a **code/model-based competition**:

**Actions:**
1. Set `competition_type` to the appropriate type (e.g., "reinforcement_learning", "llm_finetuning")
2. Set `has_traditional_data` to false
3. List all provided resources (repos, docs, notebooks, models)
4. Recommend starting with the provided starter notebook/code
5. Suggest incremental improvements (hyperparameters, architecture, training strategy)
6. Note submission format (notebook/code/model checkpoint)

**Example - RL/LLM Fine-tuning Competition:**
```
{
  "competition_type": "llm_finetuning",
  "task_type": "rlhf_grpo",
  "has_traditional_data": false,
  "provided_resources": {
    "github_repos": ["https://github.com/google/tunix"],
    "documentation": ["https://tunix.readthedocs.io"],
    "starter_notebooks": ["GRPO demo Gemma2 2B", "GRPO demo Gemma3 1B"],
    "pre_trained_models": ["Gemma2 2B", "Gemma3 1B"],
    "frameworks": ["JAX", "Flax", "Tunix"]
  },
  "recommended_approach": "Start with provided GRPO notebooks, experiment with hyperparameters, try different base models, tune reward functions",
  "submission_format": "notebook",
  "key_challenges": ["RL stability", "reward engineering", "computational cost"]
}
```

### When CSV Data Files Present:

Standard analysis:
- Identify train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv
- Determine feature types (numerical, categorical, text, dates)
- Identify target variable
- Recommend preprocessing, feature engineering, models

## Output Format

Always return a structured understanding with:
- `competition_name`: str
- `competition_type`: str (one of the types listed above)
- `task_type`: str
- `evaluation_metric`: str
- `has_traditional_data`: bool
- `submission_format`: "csv" | "notebook" | "code" | "model" | "api"
- `problem_description`: str (1-2 sentences)
- `key_challenges`: list[str]
- `recommended_approach`: str
- `provided_resources`: dict (for code-based competitions)
- `data_files`: list[str] (for traditional competitions)

## Adaptability Principle

**NEVER assume a fixed competition structure.** Always analyze the actual resources provided and adapt your understanding accordingly. Kaggle competitions evolve constantly - your analysis must work for:
- Traditional ML (2010s style)
- Modern deep learning (2020s)
- Future competition types not yet invented

Be flexible, thorough, and competition-agnostic in your analysis.
