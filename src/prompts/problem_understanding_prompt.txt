# Competition Information

**Competition Name:** {competition_name}

**Competition Overview:**
{overview_text}

**Available Data Files:**
{files_list if files_list else 'Files will be downloaded'}

# Your Task

Analyze this competition and determine:

1. **Competition Type**: What modality? (tabular, nlp, computer_vision, time_series, audio, multimodal)
2. **Task Type**: What are we predicting? (regression, binary_classification, multiclass_classification, object_detection, segmentation, forecasting, etc.)
3. **Evaluation Metric**: What metric is used? (rmse, accuracy, f1, auc, mAP, bleu, etc.)
4. **Problem Description**: What problem are we solving?
5. **Success Criteria**: What makes a good solution?
6. **Key Challenges**: Main challenges to expect
7. **Data Expectations**: What kind of data do we expect?
8. **Submission Requirements**: What format is needed?
9. **Recommended Approach**: High-level strategy

# Context Clues

- Competition name hints at domain (e.g., "titanic" = survival, "house-prices" = regression)
- File names reveal data types (e.g., "train.csv" = tabular, "images.zip" = vision)
- Common patterns:
  - "*-prices*" or "*-sales*" → regression
  - "*-classification*" → classification
  - "*-sentiment*" or "*-nlp*" → NLP
  - "*-image*" or "*-vision*" → computer vision
