# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## Kaggle-Slaying Multi-Agent System

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** Documentation Phase Complete, Implementation Starting

---

## 🎯 Vision

Build an autonomous AI system that can compete in ANY Kaggle competition and consistently reach **top 20%** on the leaderboard without human intervention.

### What Makes This Different?

**Traditional Approach:**
```
Human → Reads competition → Understands problem →
Designs solution → Writes code → Trains model → Submits
```

**Our Approach:**
```
AI System → Reads competition → Reasons about problem →
Researches solutions → Plans implementation → Executes →
Learns from feedback → Iterates → Reaches top 20%
```

The key innovation: **Reasoning-first architecture** instead of rule-based categorization.

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Design Decisions

### Why Not Hardcode Problem Types?

**Initial thought:** "Let's create specialized agents for NLP, CV, Tabular, etc."

**Problem:**
- Kaggle competitions are creative and diverse
- New problem types emerge (e.g., multi-modal, protein folding)
- Rigid categories limit adaptability

**Solution:**
- Use LLM reasoning to understand any problem
- Let the system figure out the best approach
- Build flexibility, not rigidity

---

### Why Phase 0 (Reasoning) Is Critical

**Without Phase 0:**
```
Download data → Try XGBoost → Submit → Score: 0.65 → ???
```
No understanding of why it worked or didn't work.

**With Phase 0:**
```
Understand problem → Research solutions → Plan approach →
Execute plan → Compare to expectation → Learn and improve
```
Clear reasoning at every step.

---

### Why Iteration Matters

First submission rarely reaches top 20%. The system needs to:
1. Try an approach
2. See the results
3. Diagnose what happened
4. Refine strategy
5. Try again

This mirrors how expert Kagglers work.

## 🔮 Future Possibilities

### Short Term (Months 1-3)
- Support multiple LLM providers
- Improve forum mining (parse code snippets)
- Build knowledge base of techniques
- AutoML integration (AutoGluon)

### Medium Term (Months 4-6)
- Multi-competition parallel execution
- Human-in-the-loop mode (approve strategies)
- Advanced ensemble strategies
- Meta-learning across competitions

### Long Term (Year 1+)
- Compete in real-time (live competitions)
- Team collaboration features
- Automated paper implementation
- Self-improving system (learns from all runs)
