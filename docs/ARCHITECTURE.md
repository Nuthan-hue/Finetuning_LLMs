# KAGGLE-SLAYING MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM
## Architecture Documentation v2.0

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

**Build an autonomous multi-agent team that can compete in ANY Kaggle competition and achieve top 20% ranking.**

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Autonomously understand any competition problem (CV, NLP, Tabular, Time Series, RL, or novel problem types)
- ✅ Automatically collect and analyze data
- ✅ Train appropriate models based on problem understanding
- ✅ Submit solutions via Kaggle API
- ✅ Monitor leaderboard and iteratively improve
- ✅ Achieve top 20% percentile ranking

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy: Reasoning-First Architecture

### The Problem with Pre-defined Categories

❌ **Old Approach (Rigid):**
```
IF problem == "NLP":
    use_transformer()
ELIF problem == "CV":
    use_cnn()
ELIF problem == "Tabular":
    use_xgboost()
```

**Why this fails:**
- Kaggle competitions are diverse and creative
- New competition types emerge (e.g., multi-modal, graph-based, protein folding)
- Problems don't fit neatly into boxes
- Solution approaches evolve rapidly

---

✅ **New Approach (Adaptive):**
```
1. UNDERSTAND the competition deeply using reasoning agents
2. ANALYZE what makes this problem unique
3. RESEARCH similar problems and winning solutions
4. DECIDE on approach based on evidence
5. EXECUTE with appropriate techniques
6. LEARN from results and iterate
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Phase 0: INTELLIGENT PROBLEM REASONING (NEW!)

**Decisions:**
1. **If performing well (top 20% reached):**
   - Should we ensemble with different models?
   - Can we fine-tune further?
   - Is there low-hanging fruit?

2. **If underperforming:**
   - Should we try a different strategy from the ranked list?
   - Do we need more sophisticated feature engineering?
   - Should we try ensemble methods?

3. **If stuck:**
   - Research what top performers are doing (forum mining)

## 🎯 Key Design Principles

### 1. **Reasoning Over Rules**
- Don't hardcode problem types
- Use LLM reasoning to understand novel problems
- Research and learn from past competitions

### 2. **Evidence-Based Strategy**
- Base decisions on research and data
- Reference winning solutions
- Test hypotheses systematically

### 3. **Adaptive Learning**
- Learn from leaderboard feedback
- Diagnose performance issues
- Refine strategy iteratively

### 4. **Transparency**
- Every agent explains its reasoning
- Track decision-making process
- Maintain audit trail of experiments

### 5. **Robustness**
- Validate against competition rules
- Check for common mistakes (data leakage, overfitting)
- Have fallback strategies

## 📈 Success Metrics

### System Performance
- **Primary:** % of competitions where system reaches top 20%
- **Secondary:** Average leaderboard percentile across competitions
- **Efficiency:** Number of iterations to reach top 20%

### Agent Quality
- **Reasoning Quality:** How well Phase 0 understands problems (human eval)
- **Strategy Quality:** How often recommended strategy works (% success)
- **Learning Quality:** How much improvement per iteration (delta AUC)

### Operational
- **Cost:** API costs per competition (Gemini/GPT calls)
- **Time:** Wall-clock time from start to top 20%
- **Robustness:** % of competitions completed without errors

## 🤔 Open Questions

1. **LLM Provider:** Should we support multiple LLMs (Gemini + GPT-4) or standardize?

2. **Research Depth:** How deep should SolutionStrategyAgent research?
   - Just Kaggle solutions?
   - Include recent papers?
   - Mine discussion forums?

3. **Cost Management:** How do we balance reasoning quality vs API costs?
   - Cache responses?
   - Use smaller models for some tasks?
   - Limit search depth?

4. **Human in the Loop:** Should we allow human approval of strategies before execution?

5. **Multi-Competition:** Should the system handle multiple competitions in parallel?
