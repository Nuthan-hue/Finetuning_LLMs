DESIGN DISCUSSION: Phase 2 vs Phase 3 Separation
================================================

PROBLEM: Overlap between Problem Understanding and Data Analysis

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Phase 2 (Problem Understanding) tries to guess features and data structure
- Phase 3 (Data Analysis) looks at actual data
- Result: Confusion and hallucination in Phase 2

PROPOSED CLEAR SEPARATION:

Phase 2: Problem Understanding (TEXT ONLY - NO DATA)
-----------------------------------------------------
Input: Competition description text from web scraping
Focus: WHAT are we solving? WHAT is success? HOW do we submit?

Output Should Include:
- task_type: "binary_classification"
- evaluation_metric: "accuracy" (from competition rules)
- problem_description: "Predict survival on Titanic"
- submission_format: {id_column, prediction_column}
- success_criteria: What makes a good solution
- key_challenges: High-level challenges

Should NOT Include:
❌ Expected features (guessing from thin air)
❌ Data expectations (will be wrong)
❌ Preprocessing recommendations (no data yet)

Phase 3: Data Analysis (ACTUAL DATA)
-------------------------------------
Input: Actual train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv
Focus: WHAT data do we have? WHAT needs cleaning? WHAT features exist?

Output Should Include:
- target_column: "Survived" (found in data)
- target_distribution: {"0": 549, "1": 342} (real counts)
- features: {numerical: [...], categorical: [...]} (actually present)
- missing_values: {"Age": 0.20} (real percentages)
- data_quality_issues: List of actual problems
- preprocessing_recommendations: Based on actual data
- feature_engineering_suggestions: Based on actual columns
- recommended_models: Based on data characteristics

KEY DIFFERENCE:
- Phase 2: Problem-level understanding (from competition text)
- Phase 3: Data-level analysis (from actual files)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
1. Phase 2 doesn't hallucinate about data structure
2. Phase 3 provides concrete, actionable insights
3. Clearer separation of concerns
4. Easier to debug when something goes wrong
5. AI makes decisions based on reality, not guesses

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Phase 2 should output:
{
    "task_type": "binary_classification",
    "evaluation_metric": "accuracy",
    "problem_description": "Predict survival",
    "submission_format": {...}
}

Phase 3 should output:
{
    "target_column": "Survived",
    "features": {"numerical": ["Age", "Fare"], ...},
    "missing_values": {"Age": 0.20},
    "preprocessing_needed": true,
    "feature_engineering_suggestions": [...]
}

ACTION ITEM: Refactor both prompts later (current flow works for now)
